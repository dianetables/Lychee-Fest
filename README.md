# Lychee Fest
The most epic VR experience in the world!

This project creates a VR experience that allows users to explore a carnival/festival, listen to “live” music, and play a game. I was inspired to create this experience because I often go to festivities like this with my sister so I wanted to recreate that atmosphere to share with others. This will be especially memorable in VR because it is like having the real life experience without being there. While it isn’t the most true to life experience, I think I captured a lot of what it was like to be at a festival. I also was able to show off my creative side with how I got bored and decorated the world with custom models, interesting interactions, etc.
